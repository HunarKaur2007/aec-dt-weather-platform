## 📖 Overview

This project is an AI-powered Smart Grid Energy Management System that combines weather forecasting, autonomous software agents, and intelligent optimization to improve renewable energy utilization.

The platform integrates real-time weather data from the NASA POWER API with multiple intelligent agents responsible for photovoltaic energy generation, battery storage, electric vehicle scheduling, cybersecurity monitoring, voltage regulation, and energy optimization.

Built using Python and Flask, the system demonstrates how AI-driven multi-agent architectures can efficiently manage distributed energy resources within a modern smart grid.
